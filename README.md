## Inspiration

Day before yesterday, I registered myself a domain name `krshg.tech` and I wanted to redirect my previous one, but there wasn't a great solution that had full transparency (was open source), so I decided to hand in my hand complete with a gauntlet of js code to fight this end game against we (open source) and closed source software!

After getting the approval of Dr. Strangest (Ritvi), we decided to build this awesome tool that can redirect domains to urls.

## What it does

It's an **OPEN SOURCE** tool to redirect domains to urls ðŸ‘€ I know, you probably wanna do the spider man dance after this.

But really, it's as simple as redirecting domains ðŸ”¥

## How we built it

We just threw in a bunch of infinity stones, here is how they go-

1. NextJS (The power stone) - this is what allows up to have a App
2. TailwindCSS (The reality stone) - adds beauty to our broken code
3. Prisma (The time stone) - allows us to quickly migrate back if 404 deletes are database
4. Vercel (or maybe Bercel) (The mind stone) - the place where we deploy and also the celestial that allows us a domain api that we use
5. GitHub (The space stone) - the hub/space where we host our code/issues and project management for better cooperation [But I don't have any friends to collaborate with it ðŸ˜­, will octocat be one?]
6. Ritvi (Idk what the 6th stone is) - the person who approved this Idea

## Challenges we ran into

"Everything is a challenge, but a challenge is a man, so man is everything" -- Candrew Toot, 2047

Ok but seriously-

1. Getting approval on the idea, solved using Ritvi's cosmic powers
2. NextJs getting bunch of updates and screwing our code (Abra kadabra GitHub commit revertoooo!)
3. Domains API doesn't have a js library ðŸ’€ Coded up a micro library ðŸ”¥
4. Not having friends, created fake ones with the reality stone ;)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I mean really, I am the most proud to solve the fourth challenge, but for the record, I'll say solving the 3th one was actually effort-ful (is that a word?) and now I will just copy-pasta it the next times lol

## What we learned

We learnt to conquer the mad titan, I mean the vercel domains api, we also used a bunch of stuff like prisma and typescript which further enhanced our JavaScript cosmic powers :D

## What's next for Redirekt.biz

~~Using the stones to conquer the corporate world and next year come as a sponsor to workathon~~

I mean-

- Adding in regex pattern support (we did not add it this time, because it needs complicated security logic so that I don't use your domain and you don't use my domain, but we will conquer it, like we conquered thanos's army ðŸ«¡)
